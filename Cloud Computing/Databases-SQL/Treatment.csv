1,Grape___Black_rot,"1. During your fall clean-up, make sure that all mummies have been removed from the vine and all plant material on the ground below is destroyed. 
2. Prune out any and all areas with lesions; grapevines can handle a severe pruning — when in doubt, cut it out. 
3. If leaves appear the following spring with new lesions, remove these immediately and start a spray treatment program with one of the fungicides."
2,Apple___Apple_scab,"1. Choose resistant varieties when possible.
2. Rake under trees and destroy infected leaves to reduce the number of fungal spores available to start the disease cycle over again next spring.
3. Water in the evening or early morning hours (avoid overhead irrigation) to give the leaves time to dry out before infection can occur.
4. Spread a 3- to 6-inch layer of compost under trees, keeping it away from the trunk, to cover soil and prevent splash dispersal of the fungal spores.
5. For best control, spray liquid copper soap early, two weeks before symptoms normally appear. Alternatively, begin applications when disease first appears, and repeat at 7 to 10 day intervals up to blossom drop.
6. Bonide® Sulfur Plant Fungicide, a finely ground wettable powder, is used in pre-blossom applications and must go on before rainy or spore discharge periods. Apply from pre-pink through cover (2 Tbsp/ gallon of water), or use in cover sprays up to the day of harvest.
7. Organocide® Plant Doctor is an earth-friendly systemic fungicide that works its way through the entire plant to combat a large number of diseases on ornamentals, turf, fruit and more. Apply as a soil drench or foliar spray (3-4 tsp/ gallon of water) to prevent and attack fungal problems.
8. Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide® Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water. Thoroughly spray all parts of the plant, especially new shoots."
3,Apple___Black_rot,"1. Prune out dead or diseased branches.
2. Pick all dried and shriveled fruits remaining on the trees.
3. Remove infected plant material from the area.
4. All infected plant parts should be burned, buried or sent to a municipal composting site.
5. Be sure to remove the stumps of any apple trees you cut down. Dead stumps can be a source of spores."
4,Apple___Cedar_apple_rust,"1. Choose resistant cultivars when available.
2. Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.
3. Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.
4. Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary.
5. On juniper, rust can be controlled by spraying plants with a copper solution (0.5 to 2.0 oz/ gallon of water) at least four times between late August and late October.
6. Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.
7. Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide® Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water. Thoroughly spray all parts of the plant, especially new shoots.
8. Contact your local Agricultural Extension office for other possible solutions in your area."
5,Cherry___Powdery_mildew,"1. Ensure there is enough spacing between your plants to provide enough airflow around all parts of the plant.
2. Don’t over fertilize your plants. New growth tends to be very susceptible to powdery mildew development.
3. Put plants where they will get enough light and avoid overly shady locations.
4. Make sure the soil can drain properly. Inadequate drainage can make soil a breeding ground for disease-causing organisms.
5. Use compost to boost the nutrient levels in the soil, which will in turn increase beneficial microorganism populations.
6. Keep plants properly maintained by removing any dead or diseased foliage and stems.
7. Use preventative treatment options, like a Safer® Brand Garden Fungicide, before powdery mildew even forms."
6,"Corn___Cercospora_leaf_spot Gray_leaf_spot","1. Resistant varieties: In places where leaf spot occur, these crops can ultimately grow and still be resistant to the disease. Susceptible varieties should not be planted in previously infected areas.
2. Crop rotation: The amount of initial inoculum will be reduced when a crop other than corn is planted for ≥2 years in that given area; meanwhile proper tillage methods are carried out. Clean plowing and 1-year crop rotation in the absence of corn allows for greater reductions of the disease as well. Note that conventional tilling can reduce disease but can lead to greater soil erosion.
3. Residue management: Burying the debris under the last year’s crop will help in reducing the presence of Cercospera zeae-maydis, as the fungal-infected debris can only survive above the soil surface. Again this technique will aid in reducing the primary inoculum, but it will not completely eradicate the disease.
4. Fungicides: Fungicides, if sprayed early in season before initial damage, can be effective in reducing disease. Currently there are 5 known fungicides that treat Corn grey leaf spot.
5. Planting Date: The impact of GLS is more severe if plants are affected early in their development. Early planting can help reduce yield losses by ensuring the crop is at a later stage of grain fill when conditions are typically favorable for GLS development.
6. Weed control: By removing weeds, above ground airflow to the crop is increased, relative humidity is decreased, and it limits infection at the most susceptible times."
7,Corn___Common_rust,"1. To reduce the incidence of corn rust, plant only corn that has resistance to the fungus. Resistance is either in the form of race-specific resistance or partial rust resistance. In either case, no sweet corn is completely resistant.
2. If the corn begins to show symptoms of infection, immediately spray with a fungicide. The fungicide is most effective when started at the first sign of infection. Two applications may be necessary.
3. Contact your local extension office for advice regarding specific fungicides and their uses."
8,Corn___Northern_Leaf_Blight,"1. Control of this disease is often focused on management and prevention. First, choose corn varieties or hybrids that are resistant or at least have moderate resistance to northern corn leaf blight.
2. When you grow corn, make sure it does not stay wet for long periods of time. The fungus that causes this infection needs between six and 18 hours of leaf wetness to develop. Plant corn with enough space for airflow and water in the morning so leaves can dry throughout the day.
3. The fungus overwinters in plant material, so it is also important to manage infected plants. Tilling the corn into the soil is one strategy, but with a small garden it may make more sense to just remove and destroy the affected plants.
4. Treating northern corn leaf blight involves using fungicides. For most home gardeners this step isn’t needed, but if you have a bad infection, you may want to try this chemical treatment. The infection usually begins around the time of silking, and this is when the fungicide should be applied."
9,Grape___Esca_(Black_Measles),"1. Presently, there are no effective management strategies for measles. Wine grape growers with small vineyards will often have field crews remove infected fruit prior to harvest. Raisins affected by measles will be discarded during harvest or at the packing house, while table grape growers will leave affected fruit on the vine.
2. Current research is focused on protecting pruning wounds from fungal infections to minimize suspect fungi from colonizing fresh wounds."
10,Grape___Leaf_blight_(Isariopsis_Leaf_Spot),"1. Apply dormant sprays to reduce inoculum levels.
2. In addition to dormant sprays, growers should physically remove as much inoculum as possible, either by chopping up the prunings and burning them or burying large trunks to destroy fungal pathogens.
3. Open canopies have a number of benefits for disease control: They reduce relative humidity to discourage fungal attack, increase sunlight exposure to toughen fruit skins and kill fungal spores, and improve spray coverage.
4. Don’t let down your defenses.
5. Scout vineyards early in the season before bloom, because if you see a lot of black rot spots on the leaves, or Phomopsis on the canes and leaves, that indicates that you have inoculum waiting to attack your berries.
6. Use protectant and systemic fungicides. Protectants such as mancozeb and ziram can provide economical early-season control, especially for Phomopsis and black rot, and sulfur may be used for early powdery mildew control in cultivars that are not sulfur-sensitive.
7. To reduce the risk of grape pathogens developing fungicide resistance, growers should strive to make fewer fungicide sprays and alternate between fungicide groups, as delineated by the Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC) numbers on labels.
8. Cool, wet weather favors downy mildew, black rot, Phomopsis and anthracnose, while a drier season will promote powdery mildew, so monitoring the weather is a must for determining what the fungal future holds.
9. Spray well and wisely.
10. Apply, rain, repeat and Organize your vines."
11,Orange___Haunglongbing_(Citrus_greening),"1. Only purchase plants from reputable nurseries and garden centers.
2. Do NOT move plants, fruit or plant parts out of your area, especially across state or international borders.
3. Consume fruit on your property.
4. Dry or double bag plant clippings prior to disposal.
5. When grafting trees, only use registered budwood that comes with source documentation.
6. Cooperate with officials who need to inspect or treat citrus trees in your yard or neighborhood.
7. In quarantined areas, protect your citrus trees against ACP with properly labeled foliar sprays and/or a systemic insecticide soil-drench applied prior to the flush of new growth in late summer or early fall, or in spring after bloom. Carefully follow label instructions.
8. Best of all there’s no spraying! Simply apply it around the base of your tree for systemic protection from the roots to the tip of every leaf."
12,Peach___Bacterial_spot,"1. Keep your peach trees healthy by properly pruning out any diseased or dead limbs and fertilize and water as necessary. Too much nitrogen can aggravate the disease.
2. While there are no completely successful sprays for control of this disease, chemical spray with copper based bactericide and the antibiotic oxytetracycline have some effect used preventatively.
3. Talk to your local extension office or nursery for information. Chemical control is doubtful, however, so the best long term control is to plant resistant cultivars."
13,"Pepper,_bell___Bacterial_spot","1. Peppers will benefit from applications of fertilizer to keep them supplied with essential nutrients. A timed release fertilizer can be applied at bloom or the plants can be fed with a liquid fertilizer at planting and every two weeks thereafter.
2. In addition, pepper plants can produce a heavy load of fruit and it can be helpful to provide the plants with some support using stakes or cages to prevent branches from breaking under the weight. Use a soft material to tie plants to stakes or cages."
14,Potato___Early_blight,"1. Avoid overhead irrigation and allow for sufficient aeration between plants to allow the foliage to dry as quickly as possible.
2. Practice a 2-year crop rotation. That is, do not replant potatoes or other crops in this family for 2 years after a potato crop has been harvested.
3. Keep the potato plants healthy and stress free by providing adequate nutrition and sufficient irrigation, especially later in the growing season after flowering when plants are most susceptible to the disease."
15,Potato___Late_blight,"1. Plant resistant cultivars when available. Remove volunteers from the garden prior to planting and space plants far enough apart to allow for plenty of air circulation.
2. Water in the early morning hours, or use soaker hoses, to give plants time to dry out during the day — avoid overhead irrigation. Destroy all tomato and potato debris after harvest (see Fall Garden Cleanup)."
16,Squash___Powdery_mildew,"1. Use this recipe to make your own solution—mix one tablespoon of baking soda with a teaspoon of dormant oil and one teaspoon of insecticidal or liquid soap (not detergent) to a gallon of water.
2. Spray on plants every one to two weeks."
17,Strawberry___Leaf_scorch,"1. Treat leaf scorch by letting your plants dry out. The best way to treat this disease is to alter watering practices and allow for dryer conditions.
2. If that isn’t possible, you can treat your strawberries with organic fungicides like Captan 50 WP and Copper compounds."
18,Tomato___Bacterial_spot,"1. A plant with bacterial spot cannot be cured.  Remove symptomatic plants from the field or greenhouse to prevent the spread of bacteria to healthy plants.
2. Burn, bury or hot compost the affected plants and DO NOT eat symptomatic fruit.  Although bacterial spot pathogens are not human pathogens, the fruit blemishes that they cause can provide entry points for human pathogens that could cause illness."
19,Tomato___Early_blight,"1. Keep Your Plants Dry. The Alternaria spores require a lot of moisture to germinate.
2. Tomato plants are used to growing in dry climates, so they are unusually sensitive to water on their leaves, which makes them more prone to fungal infections than many other crops."
20,Tomato___Late_blight,"1. Practice safe control methods to prevent late blight, such as practicing regular crop rotation, never planting tomatoes in the same location that tomatoes or potatoes were grown in the last two growing seasons.
2. Space all tomato plants out far enough from each other to allow for plenty of air circulation to help plants dry out faster when they get wet."
21,Tomato___Leaf_Mold,"1. Upon noticing the infected areas, the first step is to let the plants air out and dry. If they are being cultivated in a greenhouse, expose them to dry air conditions, because the humidity that the fungus needs to survive and thrive is dried up in the open air.
2. If the tomatoes are being cultivated outdoors, try to keep the leaves dry when watering the plants."
22,Tomato___Septoria_leaf_spot,"1. Removing infected leaves. Remove infected leaves immediately, and be sure to wash your hands and pruners thoroughly before working with uninfected plants.
2. Consider organic fungicide options. Fungicides containing either copper or potassium bicarbonate will help prevent the spreading of the disease. Begin spraying as soon as the first symptoms appear and follow the label directions for continued management.
3. Consider chemical fungicides. While chemical options are not ideal, they may be the only option for controlling advanced infections. One of the least toxic and most effective is chlorothalonil (sold under the names Fungonil and Daconil)."
23,"Tomato___Spider_mites Two-spotted_spider_mite","1. Water tomato plants regularly and don't allow the soil to become bone dry. Water the surrounding area because mites thrive in hot, dry, dusty conditions.
2. Direct a strong stream of water at the affected leaves as soon as you notice evidence of mites on the leaves and then repeat at least twice every week. 
3. Remove webs from tomato leaves with a damp cloth. Eliminating the webs removes the protective cover and prevents mites from laying eggs.
4. Avoid the use of pesticides, which kills lady beetles and other beneficial predators that effectively keep mites under control.
5. Spray tomato plants with horticultural oil, which smothers the mites.
6. Apply insecticidal soap spray as an alternative to horticultural oil.
7. Remove seriously infected tomato plants and start fresh with new, pest-resistant plants. Dispose of infested plants and never place the plants on the compost piles."
24,Tomato___Tomato_mosaic_virus,"1. We're sorry. There are no cures for viral diseases such as mosaic once a plant is infected. Remove and destroy all infected plants."
25,Tomato___Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus,"1. Symptomatic plants should be carefully covered by a clear or black plastic bag and tied at the stem at soil line.
2. Cut off the plant below the bag and allow bag with plant and whiteflies to desiccate to death on the soil surface for 1-2 days prior to placing the plant in the trash. Do not cut the plant off or pull it out of the garden and toss it on the compost!
3. If symptomatic plants have no obvious whiteflies on the lower leaf surface, these plants can be cut from the garden and BURIED in the compost.
4. Inspect plants for whitefly infestations two times per week. If whiteflies are beginning to appear, spray with azadirachtin (Neem), pyrethrin or insecticidal soap.
5. For more effective control, it is recommended that at least two of the above insecticides be rotated at each spraying. Follow label directions closely for dosage rates, spray intervals and precautions. Spray the undersides of the leaves thoroughly."

37,Tomato___healthy,"Your tomato is healthy, keep it going!"
38,Tomato___Target_Spot,"1. Cultural practices for target spot management include improving airflow through the canopy by wider plant spacing and avoiding over-fertilizing with nitrogen, which can cause overly lush canopy formation.
2. Pruning suckers and older leaves in the lower canopy can also increase airflow and reduce leaf wetness. 
3. Avoid planting tomatoes near old plantings. Inspect seedlings for target spot symptoms before transplanting."
